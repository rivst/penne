> Simple server-side encrypted pastebin with optional client-side zero-knowledge encryption.

## Features

- Small and fast. No JS frameworks, just plain server-rendered pages with a sprinkle of JavaScript. Next on the roadmap - no CSS frameworks to make it even leaner.
- Server-side encryption with [AES-GCM-SIV](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/168.pdf).
- Optional client-side encryption with [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/XChaCha20Poly1305) from [@noble/ciphers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ciphers) library. The key is generated randomly and included in the URL.
- Expiring anonymous pastes, no sign-up.
- Sign up for an account to create and manage non-expiring pastes.

## Running development environment

One way to generate a random key for server-side encryption is as follows. The `cryptography` package must be installed in the environment.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCMSIV
import base64
print(base64.b64encode(AESGCMSIV.generate_key(bit_length=256)))
```

Copy resulting value, omitting the `b` and paste it into `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

### Starting development server with Flask

```
flask --app penne --debug run
```

### Building CSS and JS with Webpack in watch mode

```
cd assets
npm run watch
```

## Production deployment

### Run with Podman/Docker

```
podman run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 localhost/penne:latest
```

### Run with Podman/Docker Compose

```
podman-compose up -d
```

There are other options to set environment variables in the compose file. Read more in [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/).

### Run on bare metal

penne can be easily run on bare metal just by following the same steps for creating a container.

Clone the repository.

```sh
git@github.com:rivst/penne.git
```

Build frontend assets.

```sh
npm ci && npm run prod
```

Copy built assets into `dist` directory.

Install dependencies.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install waitress
```

And serve the app.

```sh
waitress-serve --listen 0.0.0.0:5000 --call penne:create_app
```
